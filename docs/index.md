## Introduction

The ugly red book is my personal [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Its my place to share and grow my knowledge base of things I know or have learned in my professional journey. 

Somethings will be interesting to the reader and others will be completely pointless.. but they are important enough to me to warrant them being enshrined here in the garden.

If this is your first time "picking up" the ugly red book, awesome and welcome Carl! You might be in for a treat.. or you'll spend your entire time wondering what's wrong with me and creating issues on GitHub for all the typos and bad grammar.
