# Movies Everyone Should Watch (Maybe)

Hey Carl, this is a fun one. This is a list of movies that I believe everyone should watch at least once. There is no order to this list. A movie being higher on the page doesn't mean it's better or worse than any other.

Also.. take note that I didn't say all of these movies are necessarily "good." Some can be pretty awful; but you should still watch them Carl. You'll thank me once you do.. or maybe you won't.
